**TalkTerminal (Terminal Bases Chat Application using Java Sockets)**

This project is a terminal-based chat application that facilitates real-time communication between a server and a client using Java Sockets.
The server listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.
Once a connection is established, both the server and client can send and receive messages.
Communication is handled using separate threads for reading and writing messages, ensuring smooth and responsive interaction.

The project demonstrates the use of:
1. Multithreading
2. Socket programming
3. Input/output stream handling in Java
